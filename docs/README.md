# Compiling the radioactivedecay Documentation

The docs for this project are built with [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and the 
ReadTheDocs [theme](https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Use the `Makefile` in this directory to compile static HTML pages by

```bash
make html
```

The compiled docs go into the `build` directory and can be viewed by opening `html/index.html`.
