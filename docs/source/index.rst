Welcome to radioactivedecay's documentation!
============================================

``radioactivedecay`` is a Python package for radioactive decay calculations.
It fully supports radionuclide decay chains, including those with branching
decays or chains passing through metastable states. By default
``radioactivedecay`` uses the decay data from ICRP Publication 107, which
covers 1252 radionuclides of 97 elements.
